## JUCE wiring framework will appear. Click onto EqTester3, and it's GUI will show. 
## To test the equalizer, click onto EqTester (VST3) in the JUCE framework wiring and link it's inputs and outputs accordingly with either a synthesizer or mp3 audio player.
## Upon playing audio into the equalizer, move the knobs accordingly and observe the change in sound. Cutting the low frequencies should give a hollow sound on headphones, and cutting the high frequencies will make it harder to hear the audio on speakers.
